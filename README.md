# Mira API

A thorough, but simple, Among Us modding API that covers:
- Roles
- Options
- Gamemodes
- HUD Elements
- Compatibility
  
Mira API striv  es to be simple and easy to use, while also using as many base game elements as possible. The result is a less intrusive, better modding API that covers general use cases.

# Usage

To start using Mira API, you need to:
1. Add a reference to Mira API either through a DLL, project reference, or NuGet package.
2. Add a BepInDependency on your plugin class like this: `[BepInDependency(MiraApiPlugin.Id)]`
3. Implement the IMiraPlugin interface on your plugin class.

For a full example, see [this file](https://github.com/All-Of-Us-Mods/MiraAPI/blob/master/MiraAPI.Example/ExamplePlugin.cs).

## Roles
Roles are very simple in Mira API. There are 3 things you need to do to create a custom role:
1. Create a class that inherits from a base game role (like `RoleBehaviour`, `CrewmateRole`, `ImpostorRole`, etc).
2. Implement the `ICustomRole` interface from Mira API.
3. Add the `[RegisterCustomRole]` attribute to the class.

See [this file](https://github.com/All-Of-Us-Mods/MiraAPI/blob/master/MiraAPI.Example/CustomRole.cs) for a code example.

## Options
Options are also very simple in Mira API. Options are split up into Groups and Options. Every Option needs to be in a Group.

To create a group, you need to create a class that implements the `IModdedOptionGroup` interface. Groups contain two properties, the `GroupName` and `GroupColor`.

The easiest way to create an option within this group is to make a property within a class and assign one of the various Options Attributes listed below:
- `ModdedEnumOption`
- `ModdedNumberOption`
- `ModdedStringOption`
- `ModdedToggleOption`

They are used like this:
```csharp
// The first parameter is always the name of the option. The rest are dependent on the type of option.
[ModdedNumberOption("Sussy level", min: 0, max: 10)]
public float sussyLevel { get; set; } = 4f; // You can set a default value here.
```

To see a full example, see [this file](https://github.com/All-Of-Us-Mods/MiraAPI/blob/master/MiraAPI.Example/ExampleOptions.cs).

### Role Options

Options can also be used within a Role class to show up in that Role's settings. To do this, simply add your option property to the Role class and specify the `roleType` parameter in the Option attribute.

An example can be found [here](https://github.com/All-Of-Us-Mods/MiraAPI/blob/master/MiraAPI.Example/CustomRole2.cs).
