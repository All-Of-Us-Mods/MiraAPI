# Mira API

A thorough Among Us modding API that covers:
- Roles
- Options
- Gamemodes
- HUD ("Cooldown buttons")
  
Mira API strives to be simple and easy to use, while also using as many base game elements as possible. The result is a less intrusive, better modding API that covers general use cases.

# Usage

## Roles
Roles are very simple in Mira API. There are 3 things you need to do to create a custom role:
1. Create a class that inherits from a base game role (like `RoleBehaviour`, `CrewmateRole`, `ImpostorRole`, etc).
2. Implement the `ICustomRole` interface from Mira API.
3. Add the `[RegisterCustomRole]` attribute to the class.

See [this file](https://github.com/All-Of-Us-Mods/MiraAPI/blob/master/MiraAPI.Example/CustomRole.cs) for a code example.
